Simulates a Tower Defence Game by continuously taking in set commands from 
the user. Initial data such as initial conditions (lives, money, enemies),
map details (start, end, path, lake) is requested. Then specific game 
commands to simulate attacks, defence and other map environment changes. 
This program is limited to a single step iterations from the user and cannot
run automatically like modern tower defence games.
